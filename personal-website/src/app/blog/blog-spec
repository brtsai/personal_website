Goals:

User Stories:

  ***Be able to add new blog entries by creating subdirectories in a blog-entries directory
     Example directory:
      blog-entries
      --- blog-entry-one
      --- --- blog-entry-one.html
      --- --- blog-entry-one.css
      --- blog-entry-two
      --- --- blog-entry-two.html
      --- --- blog-entry-two.css

  ***I want to be able to draft a blog entry in Codepen, then copy the html that makes up
     the post over to a .html file for that specific blog entry, and the css used to a .css
     file for that blog entry.
     The html and css should then be loaded as though they were part of the html and css
     files for a component representing that blog entry when routing to the address for that 
     specific blog entry.

Developer Stories:

  ***The blog model should be able to ls for non '.' and '..' folders in a local blog-entries
     directory and create a list of subdirectories, each representing a blog entry
     Each entry should then have its '-'-delimeter separated word converted to title case
     The model's list of title case converted entries should be made available to the view
     as a map relating blog entry titles to subdirectory names.
     Example directory and subsequent mapping:
      blog-entries
      --- blog-entry-one
      --- --- blog-entry-one.html
      --- --- blog-entry-one.css
      --- blog-entry-two
      --- --- blog-entry-two.html
      --- --- blog-entry-two.css
      
      Model's blog entry mapping
      { "Blog Entry One" => :blog-entry-one, "Blog Entry Two" => :blog-entry-two}

  ***The blog model, when routed with a blog entry, displays that blog entry, styled with
     its appropriate css.
     Example route:
     blog/entry/blog-entry-one
     renders as
      ----------------
        navbar stuff
      ----------------
      [renders blog
      entry from html
      styled with the
      appropriate css]
      ----------------
        footer stuff
